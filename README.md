## Aasivak

This program bridges your Hi-Kumo heater/air conditioner system with Home Assistant.

It uses Home Assistant MQTT discovery mechanism: https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/ 

Checkout the project, either edit ```config/default.yml``` or create a ```config/local.yml``` with the properties you need to override. ```api_username``` and ```api_username``` are your Hi-Kumo app credentials. Then run ```Aasivak.py```.

Please use, clone and improve. Some things are not supported. It was tested only with my own devices and installation. This is a very early release, based on reverse engineering of the network traffic. I have no relation to Hitachi (other than using their product) and they may not like it. Use at your own perils.
